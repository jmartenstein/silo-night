      Start working on feature {{TASK_ID}}. Runs "beans prime" and "beans show {{TASK_ID}}". Use the "beans query" utility to get a list of all of the child tickets for {{TASK_ID}} Study the parents and child tickets. Work on all child tickets subtasks for {{TASK_ID}}. Use "beans update" with the "--status" option to mark the status of each ticket as in_progress. Update the beans to mark commands as done. Do not stop working until "{{TASK_ID}}" is deemed complete. When complete, create a file to be added to the pull request, titled "PR_SUMMARY.md".

      Help me do project planning. First, run "beans prime" to understand how the beans issue tracker works. Then run "beans show {{TASK_ID}}" to and review the output to understand the {{TASK_ID}} task. Come up with at least 2 features under this epic, then come up with 3-4 tasks that go under these features. Make sure each feature and epic is associated with the correct parent. Ensure that each feature and task has a detailed description with a checklist.

      Run "beans list" to get a full list of all of the beans. Then iterate over each bean, running "beans show" to better understand each item in the list. For each bean not in a "completed" state, analyze which beans have the highest priority, and which beans are blocking other beans.  

      First, run "beans update --help" to understand how the "beans update" command works.

      Use the "beans update" command with the "--blocking" parameter to denote when one bean is blocking another. Use the "--priority" argument to set the priority to one of the following values: critical, high, normal, low, deferred.

      Write whatever biases and assumptions you find to the file ASSUMPTIONS.md file.
